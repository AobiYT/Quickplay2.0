> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bugfroggy/Quickplay2.0.svg?branch=1.9-1.11.2)](https://travis-ci.org/bugfroggy/Quickplay2.0)

Quickplay for Minecraft versions `1.9` through `1.11.2` has been deprecated due to low usage and high maintenance level.
These versions of Quickplay were used by ~40 people over the course of Quickplay `2.0.0` to `2.0.3`, which is the final update.

Quickplay `1.9-1.11.2` will be supported as much as possible going into the future, but it will not receive any updates and will
not be available for download on the main Quickplay thread.
